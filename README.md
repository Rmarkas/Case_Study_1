# Case_Study_1
This document describes the data sources, data cleanup process, and data anlaysis for the GDP Ranking study conducted by the authors to answer the following important questions regarding country GDP for various income groups. The six main questions of interest are:
  1- How many countries are included in our GDP analysis?
  2- Which country has the 13th lowest GDP?
  3- What are the average comparative GDP rankings for the ‘High income: OECD’ and ‘High income: nonOECD’ groups?
  4- What does a colored scatterplot of GDP vs income group look like?
  5- What does a two-way classification table of GDP quantiles and income look like?
  6- Which lower-middle income countries have a GDP that ranks among the 38 highest?

The data used for this analysis comes from The World Bank and is staged in two CSV files:
  1- Gross Domestic Product data for 190 ranked Countries (source file)
  2- Income Data by country (source file)

The primary variables of interest in this analysis are the following:
  Short country code
  Country name
  GDP rankings
  Income Group (e.g. low,middle,high)

The two CSV tables need to be merged and cleaned after being downloaded in order to answer any questions of interest.
